# TCMobileDemo-flutter


This is a flutter demo app that implements both [TCServerSide](https://github.com/CommandersAct/tcserverside-flutter-plugin) && [TCConsent](https://github.com/CommandersAct/tcconsent-flutter-plugin/) plugins. 

Have a look at the code inside lib/Main.dart. More importantly, you'll need to read the native documentation for full details.

This app displays buttons to interact with the SDK. You can check the Xcode console or Android Logcat for SDK logging.
